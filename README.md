# P3 Background
A recreation of the Persona 3 Portable UI as a computer background.

This is a remake of another project in which I created the same background using simply Javascript, HTML and CSS. This remake makes use of VUE (and better CSS) to significantly cut down the amount of code and create a cleaner project.

The goal of this background is to display the date (day / month â€¢ day of week), time of day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, ...), the phase of the moon and the amount of days until the next full moon all displayed in the UI format from the game Persona 3 Portable. The background images are ripped from the game and change according to the time of day.
